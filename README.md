# Blinkit-Sales-Analysis-EDA-Project

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Blinkit retail sales data to uncover key insights about product performance, outlet characteristics, and customer preferences. The analysis helps identify trends that drive sales and supports data-driven decision making.



##  Objectives

* Analyze sales distribution across different product categories
* Understand the impact of fat content on sales
* Evaluate outlet performance based on size, type, and location tier
* Identify top-performing categories and outlets



##  Tools & Technologies Used

* Python 
* Pandas (Data Manipulation)
* NumPy (Numerical Operations)
* Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
* Jupyter Notebook



##  Key Insights

* **Low Fat products dominate sales (64.6%)** compared to Regular products (35.4%), indicating customer preference for healthier options.

* **Top categories**:

  * Fruits & Vegetables (~178K)
  * Snack Foods (~175K)

* **Lowest performing category**:

  * Baking Goods (~82K)

* **Outlet Tier Performance**:

  * Tier 3: ~472K (Highest sales)
  * Tier 2: ~393K
  * Tier 1: ~336K

* **Outlet Size Contribution**:

  * Medium: 42.3% (Highest)
  * Small: 37%
  * High: 20.7% (Lowest)

* **Outlet Establishment Trend**:

  * Older outlets (around 1998) show higher sales
  * Significant dip observed in 2011 establishments
  * Sales remain stable for newer outlets

* **Fat Content vs Outlet Tier**:

  * Low Fat products outperform Regular across all tiers
  * Tier 3 outlets generate maximum revenue for both categories



##  Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations such as:

* Bar Charts
* Pie Charts
* Horizontal Bar Plots
* Line Charts

These help in understanding sales distribution and trends effectively.

##  Conclusion

Overall, the analysis shows that Low Fat products dominate sales (64.6% vs 35.4%), with Fruits & Vegetables (~178K) and Snack Foods (~175K) being the top-performing categories, while Baking Goods (~82K) lag behind. Tier 3 outlets lead with ~472K sales, followed by Tier 2 (~393K) and Tier 1 (~336K), and Medium-sized outlets contribute the most (~42.3%), indicating that mid-sized stores in higher-tier locations drive maximum revenue.
